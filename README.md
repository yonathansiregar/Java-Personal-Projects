All my projects here are made in Java Programming Language. I'll add more my projects here.

This simple game program is made in December 28th, 2020. It took for a day to finish this program. I'll also keep update this program to be better program later.
2. Simple Calculator.
This program is made in December 30th, 2020 and the last project in 2020. It took for a day to finish this program. I also put the executable jar file in "out\artifacts\Simple_Calculator.jar" if you want to try my calculator.
